<p>Slack makes it simple to follow conversations or find important information in an easily searchable archive.Unlike email, Slack lets you choose which conversations are most important - and which can wait.Instead of a single overstuffed inbox, conversations in Slack happen in dedicated spaces called channels.
  
We're building a strong, diverse team of curious, creative people who want to find a purpose in their work and support each other in the process. We work hard and we play to win... within normal business hours. And then we go home.That balance is important: It enables us to truly do the best work of our lives. As a result, we create a place where all kinds of work happens - and happens well - all while working alongside people we respect and admire.
